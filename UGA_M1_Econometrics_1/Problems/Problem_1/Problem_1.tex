\begin{problem}[Wooldridge B.10]
  Suppose that at a large university, college grade point averages,
  $GPA$, and SAT score, $SAT$, are related by $\Er[GPA|SAT] = 0.70 +
  0.002 SAT$. 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the expected $GPA$ when $SAT=800$. Find
    $\Er[GPA|SAT=1400]$. Comment on the difference.
  \item\label{b10.2} If the average $SAT$ in the university is 1100,
    what is the average $GPA$?
  \item If a student's SAT score is 1100, does this mean he or she
    will have the GPA found in (\ref{b10.2})? Explain.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}\label{monet}
  A Monet expert is given a painting purported to be a lost Monet.  He
  is asked to assess the chances that it is genuine and has the
  following information:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In general, only 1\% of the ``found'' paintings he receives
    turn out to be genuine, an event weâ€™ll call $G$
  \item ``Found'' paintings have a different frequency of use of
    certain pigments than genuine Monets do:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item cadmium yellow Y appears in 30\% ``found'' paintings, but
      only 10\% genuine ones
    \item raw umber U appears in 90\% of ``found'' paintings, but only
      40\% of genuine ones
    \item burnt sienna S appears in 20\% of ``found'' paintings, but
      70\% of genuine paintings
    \end{enumerate}
  \item This particular painting uses burnt sienna, but not cadmium
    yellow or raw umber. 
  \end{itemize}
  What is the probability that this particular painting is genuine? Do
  we have to make any additional assumptions to answer the question?

\begin{problem}
  Let $\{(x_i,y_i): i=1,2,...,n\}$ be a sample. Let $\bar{x}
  = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ and $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} 
  \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ be the sample means of $X$ and $Y$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{hk1} Show that $\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = 0$
  \item Using the result in part (\ref{hk1}), show that 
    \[ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i (x_i -
    \bar{x}) \]
  \item Show that
    \[ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
    (y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i (x_i - \bar{x}) \]
  \end{enumerate}
